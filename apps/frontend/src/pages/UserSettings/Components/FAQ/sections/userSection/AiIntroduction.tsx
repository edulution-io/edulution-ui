      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer
        systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information),
        reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular
        applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to
        automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on
        the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What is Deep Learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of
        learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep
        neural network.
