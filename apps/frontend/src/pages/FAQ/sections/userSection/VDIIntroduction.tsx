      <h2>VDI Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        VDI stands for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. It is a technology that allows users to access a desktop
        operating system and applications from a remote location. VDI is typically used by organizations to provide
        employees with access to their work desktops from anywhere, at any time, using any device.

      <p>
        VDI works by hosting desktop operating systems and applications on a centralized server or cloud environment.
        Users can then access their virtual desktops using a client application on their device, such as a laptop,
        tablet, or smartphone. The client application connects to the VDI server, which streams the desktop environment
        to the user's device over the internet.

        VDI offers several benefits, including improved security, centralized management, and increased flexibility for
        users. It allows organizations to provide employees with secure access to their work desktops from anywhere,
        without the need for a physical desktop computer. VDI is also useful for remote work, as it allows employees to
        access their work desktops from home or other locations.

        In this section, we will cover the basics of VDI, including how it works, its benefits, and how to get started
        with VDI.
